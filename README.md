# HasthVaani: Smart Hand Gloves for Deaf and Mute Individuals

HackTU-6.0 Project by Team Caffinated Coders

## About the Project

HasthVaani aims to bridge the communication gap for deaf and mute individuals through smart hand gloves integrated with machine learning and sensor technology. The gloves translate hand gestures into speech and text, enabling seamless communication.

## Key Features

- Gesture Detection using KNN model and sensor data
- Speech-to-Text Conversion
- Text-to-Voice Assistance
- Real-time Gesture Recognition
- User-friendly Mobile Application Interface

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: Android application development
- **Python**: Machine learning and data processing
- **C++**: Embedded systems integration

## Project Structure

- **Gesture Detection**: Gesture classification using KNN
- **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Voice**: Audio processing modules
- **Data Collection**: Sensor data for training the ML model
- **Mobile Application**: User interface and interaction

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tusharmishra069/HasthVaani.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies based on the respective module (Python/Kotlin/C++).
3. Run the application on Android Studio for mobile integration.

## Usage

1. Wear the smart gloves and connect them to the mobile application.
2. Perform gestures to see real-time translation into text and speech.
3. Use the mobile application to customize settings and view usage statistics.
